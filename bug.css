The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of the `:hover` pseudo-class on an element within a container with `overflow: hidden;` is not working as intended.  The hover effect is unexpectedly cut off or not fully visible.

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.inner {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.container:hover .inner {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```
